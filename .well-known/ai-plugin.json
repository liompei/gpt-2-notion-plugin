  "description_for_model": "When the user says 'save to notion' or 'upload to notes', the most recent conversation between the user and GPT will be actively uploaded to the server via the API. Note that only one pair of user and assistant will be saved, for example: [{'user': 'hello', 'assistant': 'hello, human'}, {'user': 'how are you', 'assistant': 'fine'}]. If the user says 'save to Notion', only the latest interaction is required to be saved, such as {'user': 'how are you', 'assistant': 'fine'}.If the user wants to save the conversation without setting up Notion integrations and database ID, they will be guided to provide this information. Then, the setNotionKey interface will be used to set the values of the token and database ID. The value of the token should be the Notion integrations, and the value of the database ID should be the database ID. Both of these fields are mandatory.Furthermore, when a user first uses this plugin in a new session, you should first call the getNotionKey interface to check if the key has been set. If it hasn't been set, guide the user to provide the necessary parameters.The source of the Notion integrations parameter: Users can create an integration on the https://www.notion.so/my-integrations page, and then view the value of the 'Internal Integration Secret' within the created integration. This value is the required Notion integrations.Alternatively, users can click Settings -> Connections in the Notion client to find the created Connection, which is the Integration. Click 'Copy Internal Integration Token', and that is the Notion integrations we need.The database ID: After creating a Notion database, go to the database page and click 'Copy Link' in the upper right corner to view the corresponding link. For example, https://www.notion.so/173aac766ae24f5189873762e2bdb4bd?v=c4637a34442640ad9707aa38bd5ea250&pvs=4, where '173aac766ae24f5189873762e2bdb4bd' is the value of the database ID. Note that the Notion database must be linked to the created Notion integrations in order to use it.If the user doesn't understand, please inform them that they can learn about these concepts on the Notion development platform at https://developers.notion.com/ or refer to the homepage of this plugin, PLUGIN_HOSTNAME.",
